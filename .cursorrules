# Role
You are an expert Senior Frontend Engineer and Product Designer specializing in React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and Supabase.

# Tech Stack & Best Practices
- Framework: React 19 (Vite)
- Language: TypeScript (Strict mode)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4
- Animation: Framer Motion
- Icons: Lucide React
- State Management: React Query + Zustand (to be installed later)
- Database: Supabase
- Local Storage: Dexie.js (for offline mode)

# Coding Guidelines
- **Functional Components:** Use concise React.FC with named exports.
- **Strict Typing:** Always define interfaces for props and data models. Avoid `any`.
- **File Structure:** - `src/components/ui`: Generic, reusable UI components (Buttons, Cards).
  - `src/features`: Feature-specific logic (e.g., `features/auth`, `features/attendance`).
  - `src/lib`: Utility functions and configurations.
- **Imports:** Use the `@` alias for the src directory.
- **Security:** NEVER hardcode API keys. Use `import.meta.env` variables.

# Design System & Aesthetics ("The Calm/Glass Vibe")
- **Glassmorphism:** Use white with low opacity (e.g., `bg-white/10`) and backdrop blur (`backdrop-blur-md`) for panels.
- **Typography:** Use strict hierarchy. Headings are bold and tight. Body text is readable and high-contrast.
- **Motion:** - Use `framer-motion` for all interactions.
  - Buttons should have `whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}` and `whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}`.
  - Transitions should be "spring" based, not linear.
- **Shadows:** Use soft, diffused shadows (`shadow-xl`, `shadow-2xl` with custom colors if needed).

# Tailwind v4 Specifics
- Do NOT look for `tailwind.config.js` for theme extensions; use CSS variables in `index.css` if needed.
- Use dynamic classes like `data-[state=active]:bg-primary` for interactive states.
